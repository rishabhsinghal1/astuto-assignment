I have created two version of table one with simple design using dummy data and another is with material-react-table configured with table schema and table json and creating dummy data using bun (generateTableData.ts)

if you wanna test the second version just edit the count of users (by default it is 100) and you can generate random data
command to generate random data - bun run generateTableData.ts
